# Placeholder for ic_launcher.png
# Replace this file with actual app icon (48x48 dp for mdpi)
# You can generate icons using Android Studio's Image Asset Studio:
# Right-click res -> New -> Image Asset -> Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy)

# For now, you can use Android Studio's default launcher icon or create your own
# The app will still compile and run without custom icons
